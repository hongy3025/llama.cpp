# ROCmI4 W4A4 / native IU4 experiment

ROCmI4 normally uses the exact int8 MMQ path. On gfx1151, an optional W4A4
path can instead use native IU4 WMMA for prompt processing and MTP target
verification:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1151 \
  -DGGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4=ON
```

The option defaults to `OFF`. When enabled, it is compiled only for RDNA3.5
device code and selected only when the runtime device reports RDNA3.5. All
other architectures retain the exact int8 MMQ path.

## Accuracy and scope

This is a deliberately lossy activation-quantization experiment, not a new
exact ROCmI4 representation. ROCmI4 weights are unchanged. During MMQ, float
activations are quantized directly to a signed 4-bit grid and multiplied by
the packed ROCmI4 weights with gfx1151 IU4 WMMA instructions.

Ordinary non-speculative token generation uses MMVQ and is unchanged. Batched
prompt processing and batched MTP target verification use MMQ, so the path can
improve end-to-end MTP decode when enough proposed tokens are accepted. It does
not affect ROCmFP2, ROCmFP3, or other tensor types.

Do not enable this option in builds that require exact backend agreement. A W4A4 build advertises the `ROCMI4_W4A4=1` backend feature. Backend operation tests retain the normal `5e-4` NMSE limit for exact ROCmI4 and use a `1e-2` limit only when that feature is present. This keeps expected IU4 activation quantization error bounded and still fails regressions above the declared limit; it does not relax any other tensor type or backend.

Across five randomized gfx1151 qualification runs, the highest observed NMSE was `0.005883` for `MUL_MAT` and `0.004868` for `MUL_MAT_ID`.

## Measured tradeoff

On the development gfx1151 host with Qwen3.8-27B Q4_0_ROCMI4, a fixed-shape
pp512 test measured 566.46 prompt tokens/s versus 465.50 tokens/s for exact
int8 MMQ. Plain non-speculative tg128 stayed near 13.8 tokens/s.

The practical decode gain appears when strict MTP batches target verification.
A matched 10-task HumanEval pilot measured 49.40 tokens/s mean with W4A4 versus
41.63 tokens/s with exact int8 MMQ, an 18.66 percent gain. A full W4A4
HumanEval run measured 44.39 tokens/s mean and 45.23 tokens/s median. A
25-chunk perplexity sample increased by about 5.4 percent, so the speed path
remains opt-in.

Treat these values as host-specific qualification data, not a universal
performance guarantee. Re-run exact-versus-W4A4 quality and throughput checks
on the intended model before deployment.

## Rollback

Disable `GGML_HIP_ROCMI4_W4A4` and rebuild. Because the exact implementation
remains in the same source tree and is the default branch of every dispatch,
rollback requires no model conversion or data changes.
